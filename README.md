## Downloads

### Add this repo to Tachiyomi (v0.15.2 and later)

Starting with the latest [Tachiyomi version](https://tachiyomi.org/download/) (v0.15.2 and later), you can now add external extension repos without having to re-approve unofficial extensions after each app launch!


1. Update to the latest version of [Aniyomi]
2. Go to Settings > Browse > Extension repos > Add
3. Enter the following URL and accept: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MR-Goldenyt/TachiyomiExtensionsRevived/refs/heads/repo/index.min.json`
4. Go to the extension management screen, refresh it, and you can now download the removed extensions.
5. After installing an extension, you need to approve it by tapping on the 'Trust' button.

> [!NOTE]
> All extensions in this repo have a custom package name. While this technically allows you to install them alongside the old removed official extensions, it is not recommended and can cause issues. Uninstall the old extensions to avoid source conflicts.

### Direct APK downloads
You can also directly download the APK files in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/MR-Goldenyt/TachiyomiExtensionsRevived/tree/repo/apk).

After installing any unofficial extension, you must **manually** enable the extension in Tachiyomi.
